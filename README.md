I have finally finished this application and am excited to share it with others. It is now complete and ready for use.

## About

This project is a Launch Card Flask Application designed to display SpaceX launch data in a convenient and user-friendly way. The application fetches data from the SpaceX API and uses a macro-based HTML template to render the launch information dynamically. It provides an organized and visually appealing interface for users to explore the latest SpaceX launches.
